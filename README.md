Simple mean app to run this app you need to follow these steps:

1: First install node and mongodb.

2: run mongodb.

3: run command "npm install" from Node.Js command prompt inside the project.

4: run command "node server.js".

5: this app is running at port:3000 on browser open localhost:3000.


That's all for now.
